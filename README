--------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1, 07/21/2014
-----------------------


Building:
---------

To build the package, use make. The Makefile should currently work for Mac OS out of the box. Support for other operating systems will follow.

Running:
--------

In test you can find a simple makefile who generate a test executable.

Todo:
----- 

* need block operators: 
  + amc13 header
    - packer
    - unpacker
  + amc13 trailer
    - packer
    - unpacker

* emutf_operator_builder:
  + assemble_block_vector is a noop

l1_event_generator:
  * generate random, but internally consistent emutf_ and amc13_events
